Gillian-C2 (Alternative C Instantiation)
========================================

.. danger::

  Gillian-C2 is currently in development and unstable.

Gillian-C2 is a new instantiation of Gillian to the C language (or more precisely, CBMC's `GOTO-C <https://diffblue.github.io/cbmc/group__goto-programs.html>`_). It can be found in the ``Gillian-C2`` folder of the repository.

Gillian-C2 requires CBMC to be present on your path. Gillian-C2 is currently built to work with CBMC version |cbmc_version| -- newer versions are known to cause problems.
