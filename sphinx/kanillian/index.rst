Kanillian (New Gillian-C)
=========================

.. danger::

  Kanillian is currently in development and unstable.

Kanillian is a new instantiation of Gillian to the C language (or more precisely, CBMC's `GOTO-C <https://diffblue.github.io/cbmc/group__goto-programs.html>`_). It can be found in the ``kanillian`` folder of the repository.

Kanillian requires CBMC to be present on your path.

.. attention::

  Kanillian is currently built to work with CBMC version |cbmc_version| - newer versions are known to cause problems.
